	1. SYSCLK frequency could be changed only by reprogramming. So no dynamic changes are allowed. The main reason is the big amount of time-dependent functions because of control theory implementations.
	 	 Every SYSCLK change should be carefully traced in all time-related setups.
	 	 Only frequencies multiple to 1 Mhz are allowed.
